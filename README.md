# Project Title
A minimalisttic echo server based on Java 11 and micronaut to test networking infrastructure and policies in a Kubernetes cluster. 
This is an echo server for testing networking infrastructure in a micro-services architecture. When deploying in Kubernetes, testing the correctness of pods and the policies associted with it, needed a lot of complicated work. 
The echo server supports dependent echo calls to other micro-services and so on.
